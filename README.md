# Infinite TicTacToe

Welcome to Infinite TicTacToe â€“ Tic Tac Toe taken to the next level! 
Players engage in a battle aiming to connect three pieces as in traditional Tic Tac Toe. However, there's a twist! 
After each successful connection, pieces disappear and the game continues, creating a complex and dynamic playing experience.
The game is hosted on [my webpage](https://skrzypczakm.sprytnykartel.pl/infinite-tic-tac-toe/).
